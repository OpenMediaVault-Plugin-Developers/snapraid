Description: SnapRAID is a backup program for disk arrays.
 SnapRAID is a backup program for disk arrays.
 .
 SnapRAID stores redundancy information in the disk array, and it allows recovering from up to two disk failures.
 .
 SnapRAID is mainly targeted for a home media center, where you have a lot of big files that rarely change.
 .
 Beside the ability to recover from disk failures, the other features of SnapRAID are:
 - You can start using SnapRAID with already filled disks.
 - The disks of the array can have different sizes.
 - You can add more disks at any time.
 - If you accidentally delete some files in a disk, you can recover them.
 - If more than two disks fail, you lose the data only on the failed disks. All the data in the other disks is safe.
 - It doesn't lock-in your data. You can stop using SnapRAID at any time without the need to reformat or move data.
 - All your data is hashed to ensure data integrity and avoid silent corruption.
